# BrainTumorClassifier
In this project we make several CNN models, improve their accuracy and learn about the consequences of changing certain parameters in the CNN. 

Only requirement is having the most updated version of jupyter notebook if going for offline use. For online use there really aren't any requirements.


Everything is explained in the jupyter notebook so no need for a comprehensive README.

Enjoy.
